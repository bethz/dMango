Welcome to dMango!

Mangos have many integrated pieces, skin, pulp, seeds and sometimes various other parts. In order to truly enjoy a mango, you have to successfully "clean" it's parts. The same is true with data. You have to successfully "clean" your data in order to truly enjoy it and use it to its' full potential.

Here are some typical data cleaning activities that are frequently performed manually:

- de-duplicate rows
   - with file sorting
   - without file sorting
- de-duplicate rows
- compare files checksum to determine if they are the same
- remove rows if they start with a specific string
- remove cols if they start with a specific string
- remove rows based on dups within  one col without sort
Additional info:
- removing duplicate files saves disk space cost in the cloud
- removing duplicate data in  files saves disk space too
- quickly sum a single column from cmd line
- quickly sum a particular group entry
- quickly find unique values in first column
- remove headers

I have scripts for these activities and as well as a number of others.  I will incrementally test and upload scripts I have to perform these functions. Most are in bash, awk or other commandline. Microsoft now offers a linux subsystem in Windows so you can enjoy them too.
